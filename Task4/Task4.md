# 4. Single Page Application (SPA) Structure (5 Marks)

## a) Define SPA

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with users by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. The initial load includes all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, and subsequent interactions only fetch data as needed, updating the current page without full page reloads. This creates a more fluid, app-like experience similar to native desktop applications.

## b) Two Advantages of SPA Structure

### 1. Enhanced User Experience
- Faster navigation between views as only data is transferred, not entire pages
- Smooth, seamless transitions without page refreshes
- More responsive interface with instant feedback
- Native app-like experience in the browser
- Reduced server requests after initial load

### 2. Improved Development Efficiency
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Easier to maintain and scale as frontend and backend can be developed independently
- Reusable components and modular architecture
- Simplified state management across the application
- Better caching capabilities for static resources
